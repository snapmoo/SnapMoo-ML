  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Machine Learning is tasked with processing the dataset and building a model that will be used to process images of cow limbs that will be detected to determine whether the cow has FMD or not.

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <h4>Stage 1: Gathering and Cleaning Dataset</h4>
      <p>
        Gathering the dataset and cleaning the dataset where we removed inappropriate images and added some images from Google. Then, the processed dataset was uploaded to the ML team's Goggle Drive so that it could be accessed by all members. 
      </p>
    <h4>Stage 2: Image Preprocessing and Data Augmentation</h4>
      <p>
        We perform various types of preprocessing on the datasets to try each type of dataset to avoid overfitting or underfitting and to improve model curation. Some types of datasets are:
        <br>1. The original dataset is without the addition of images from Google and without augmentation. 
        <br>2. Datasets that have added several images from Google and without augmentation.
        <br>3. Original dataset that is without the addition of images from Google and has been augmented. 
        <br>4. Dataset that has been added several images from Google and has been augmented.
      </p>
    <h4>Stage 3: Build The Model</h4>
      <p>
        Build the model architecture using TensorFlow. Try various CNN model architectures from training from scratch (without using base model and transfer learning), try with base model, and try with transfer learning.

    <h4>Stage 5: Optimizing Model Performance</h4>
